# GoGreen
A console application where the customer can explore information about product and buy it. In addition, the seller can edit, add or delete the product.

## Description
The project implements a number of design patterns such as Factory method, Facade, Singleton, Commande, and Memento in the context of a shop.

## Usage
- After starting the program, you need to register by entering the login and password. If the program was launched earlier, use `Authorizes the user`
- There are several levels of access to the application - client and administrator. The administrator has an extended set of commands compared to the client. To log in as an administrator, enter the login `admin` and the password `admin`
- The client can go to the page with the products and their description. When the customer has decided on the purchase, he needs to add it to the cart and then proceed to checkout. The client can view the items in the shopping cart at any time and delete them
- The administrator can remove products from the store or add new ones. In addition, the administrator has the ability to hide or show the required command. For example, the `Print a list of all registered users` command is hidden by default
